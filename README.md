## Animal-Detection-on-Agricultural-land-using-Computer-Vision
India is a country of farmers. Every farmer is worried about safety of crops from weeds, insects and see animal intrusion like elephant,cow and monkeys  etc. Using computer vision we can make animal detection system to detect animals and create alarm sound.
## Dataset

Data set of Indian elephants, cows and goats have been scraped from google images. Data set directory structure is shown below.
